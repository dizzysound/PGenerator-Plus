# Regression: the deploy console's pre-apply perl -c check stages only the
# SELECTED files. A module left out of the selection that has its own
# self-locating BEGIN block -- `unshift @INC, "$directory/../share/PGenerator"`
# in a usr/sbin script, or `use lib File::Basename::dirname(__FILE__)` in a
# usr/share/PGenerator module -- loads from its REAL installed path when not
# staged, and its own self-location then re-prioritizes the installed
# directory ahead of the staged tree for the REST of that perl -c process
# (@INC is process-global). A sibling module's new export in the staged tree
# then goes unseen even though the file on disk is correct.
#
# 2026-09-21 incident: selecting only usr/sbin/pgenerator-lg and
# usr/share/PGenerator/PGLGCapabilities.pm (PR23's new
# lg_record_setting_observations export) failed the syntax check with
# "is not exported by the PGLGCapabilities module", solely because
# usr/share/PGenerator/PGAutomation.pm (unmodified, not part of the
# selection, has `unshift @INC, $directory` at its own top) was pulled in
# from the real install and won the @INC race.
#
# The fix backfills the staged usr/share/PGenerator with the installed
# directory's files, never overwriting what was staged, before running any
# check, so self-locating modules always resolve into the SAME complete
# directory regardless of what was selected.
